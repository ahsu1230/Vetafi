# Setting up Shoebox
Shoebox is the server that handles all control logic in the application. This includes authentication, handling user information, it is basically the bulk of the main logic put together into a box, like a shoebox!

### Install Node
If you haven't already, we'll need to install node. Run the following at the same directory level as _package.json_.
```
$ npm install
```

### Install MongoDb No-SQL Database
Refer to the [MongoDb installation page](https://docs.mongodb.com/master/installation/) to install.
We used Homebrew to install Mongo.
```
$ brew install mongodb
```

### Install Redis In-Memory DataStore
We used NPM to install [Redis](http://redis.io/).
```
$ npm install redis
```

## Running Shoebox locally
Make sure a _MongoDb_ instance is started in a separate terminal, we assume the database is on port 27017.
```
$ mongod
```
or
```
$ ./start-mongod.sh
```

Make sure a _Redis_ instance is started in a separate terminal, we assume the database is on port 6379.
```
$ redis-server
```
or
```
$ ./start-redis.sh
```

Simply run the _start.sh_ script from the command line. The server should start up at port 3999.
```
$ ./start-server.sh
```

## Codebase Organization
The codebase directories are organized as such:
- config		    configuration utilities to help bind together third-party services
- controllers		endpoint logic for requests
- services		  app logic to manipulate databases
- models		    database access objects that represent db tables
- middlewares		utilities to help process requests before hitting the controllers
- tests         unit tests
- utils         general programming utilities and constants
- webapp        the front-end web application to be served
