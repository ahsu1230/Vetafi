# Setting up the web application

Clone this git repository.
In the same directory as _package.json_, run in the command line:

```
$ npm install
```

This will install all NPM dependencies for this project (specified in the _package.json_ file)

From there, just run in the command line:
```
$ gulp
```

This will pre-compile and create all the necessary files for the application and place them into the _build/_ directory
From there, _BrowserSync_ will host a local webserver to automatically display the web app.
